# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
### Added
- Add a web app, which runs all commands in the browser with a live preview
  of the result next to the original. It can be built with `web/build.py` and
  is published with GitHub Pages.
- Add `pipeline` module, which runs the steps of all commands at once on the
  content of bib files, without asking for input. It keeps track of where each
  entry comes from and which fields changed.
- Add `util.parse_bib_string`, `util.parse_abbr_string`,
  `util.format_bib_entries`, and `util.get_entry_spans`, which work on strings
  instead of files.
- Add a `resolver` argument to `remove_duplicate_entries`, a function that
  decides which entry of a pair of duplicate entries to remove.
- Add `modernize_bib_file.modernize_entry`,
  `filter_bib_file.filter_cited_entries`, and
  `filter_bib_file.parse_bbl_keys`.
- In the removal of duplicate entries, typing `0` will continue the process
  without deletig any of the two entries. A skipped pair is not asked about
  again.
- Add `KEY_DATE`, `KEY_DOI`, and `KEY_ISBN` keywords to constants
- Add new `filter-cited` command that keeps only the entries of a bib file
  that are cited in a `.bbl` file (biblatex/biber or BibTeX). Entries that
  cited entries refer to, e.g., via `crossref` or `xdata`, are kept as well.

### Changed
- Move `DEFAULT_REMOVE` from the command line modules to `const`.
- Finding duplicate entries is several times faster for large bib files. The
  duplicates are found only once instead of after every removed entry, and
  titles are compared with a quick upper bound of their similarity first.
- When renaming duplicate IDs in `clean` and `combine`, the first entry keeps
  its ID, e.g., `key` and `key:b` instead of `key:a` and `key:b`. BibTeX and
  biber use the first entry as well, so citations of `key` keep working. New
  IDs no longer collide with existing ones, and the renamed IDs are shown as a
  warning.
- Duplicate entries are no longer removed by default in `clean`, `modernize`,
  and `combine`, so entries are only removed when this is intended. The
  `--force` option is replaced by `--remove-duplicates`, which removes the
  entry with less fields of each pair, and `-i`/`--interactive`, which asks for
  each pair (the previous default).
- The `force` argument of `remove_duplicate_entries` is replaced by
  `interactive` (default `False`), and the `force` argument of the main
  functions by `remove_duplicates` and `interactive` (both default `False`).

### Fixed
- Abbreviations from an abbreviation file (`clean -a`) are no longer added to
  the global strings of bibtexparser, where they were used for all bib files
  that were loaded later.
- Invalid input in the interactive prompt for removing duplicate entries (in
  all commands), e.g., `3`, no longer crashes the program. The prompt is
  repeated instead.
- Entries containing `%` comments, e.g., a commented out field, are no longer
  silently dropped when loading a bib file. Entries that still cannot be read,
  e.g., due to a missing comma, are listed in a warning.
- The removal of duplicate entries no longer treats different works as
  duplicates: entries with different DOIs, arXiv IDs, or ISBNs, and entries
  other than articles and conference papers from different years, e.g., two
  editions of a book, are kept. Automatically removed entries are listed in
  a warning.
- The removal of duplicate entries no longer crashes on entries without a
  title or author. The editor is used for entries without an author.
- `modernize --iso4` no longer crashes with a `UnicodeDecodeError` on Windows,
  where pyiso4 read its abbreviation list with the cp1252 encoding. The list
  is also loaded only once instead of for every entry, which took about a
  second per entry.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-10-15
### Added
- Add `KEY_EDITOR` and `KEY_BOOKTITLE` keywords to constants
- Add `clean_bib_file.get_duplicate_entries` function that returns duplicate
  entries based on their similar titles, authors, and other information
- Add `clean_bib_file.remove_duplicate_entries` function that removes duplicate
  entries based on the content (similar titles, authors, ...). Additionally,
  this function is applied to all main functions after loading the bib files.
- Add new `--force` option for the CLI commands, which skip the interactive
  prompt for removing duplicate citations.

### Changed
- Rename the `clean_bib_file.get_duplicates` function to
  `clean_bib_file.get_duplicate_ids`.
- Rename the `clean_bib_file.replace_duplicates` function to
  `clean_bib_file.replace_duplicate_ids`.
- Move `modernize_bib_file.getnames()` to `util.getnames()`



## [0.4.0] - 2024-02-14
### Added
- Added function to abbreviate journal names based on the ISO4 standard using
  the `pyiso4` implementation as part of the `modernize` command. 

### Changed
- Update packaging structure and metadata from old `setup.py` to
  `pyproject.toml`
- Change minimum Python version requirement to 3.8 due to the pyiso4 dependency



## [0.3.1] - 2022-02-17
### Added
- A completely refactored command line interface using the `click` library is
  added. This will replace the current CLI in a future version.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in getting author names when shielded umlauts were already
  present.



## [0.3.0] - 2021-11-29
### Added
- It is now possible to change the sorting of the entries when writing to a
  file
- Added the `shield_title` argument for modernizing the title field, which
  allows adding/removing curly brackets around the title field.
  The argument can be used by setting the `--shield_title` flag in the
  `modernize` command.

### Changed
- The fields `keyword` and `keywords` do not get removed by default
- Surrounding curly brackets in the title field are removed by default. Use the
  `--shield_title` argument to avoid this.



## [0.2.2] - 2021-01-22
### Fixed
- Already converted unicode symbols are not touched when cleaning unicode 
  characters.
- Improve author name cleaning in `modernize` subcommand. Names that are
  shielded by `{}` are now split into first and last names respecting the
  grouping.



## [0.2.1] - 2021-01-11
### Fixed
- Acronyms that are already shielded by `{}` will not be shielded again when
  modernizing a bib file.



## [0.2.0] - 2021-01-04
### Added
- Added subcommand functionality. Available subcommands are `clean`, `combine`,
  and `modernize`.
- Added `clean` functionality, that e.g., allows renaming duplicate IDs.
- Added `combine` functionality that allows combining multiple bib files into a
  single one.
- The minimum required version of Python is 3.7.



## [0.1.1] - 2020-12-17
### Fixed
- Fix issue when using `--replace_ids` with author names that already contain
  unicode characters in ASCII LaTeX format, e.g., \"{O} instead of Ö.



## [0.1.0] - 2020-12-17
### Added
- Script to clean bib files with the following features
- Page field is cleaned (en-dash `--` is used to separate numbers)
- Month field is cleaned (numbers are used instead of the old `jan` format)
- Eprint field is cleaned ("arXiv:" is stripped)
- Title field is cleaned (acronyms are shielded with curly brackets)
- Support for adding `primaryClass` field for arXiv articles
- Entry-IDs can be replaced with the scheme `<Author><year><firstWordOfTitle>`
